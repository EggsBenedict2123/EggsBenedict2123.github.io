# Visual Search Engine Suggester
 An attempt to show how words are saved in a search engine. Refreshing the page will delete everything it has saved. Tons of bugs, colors/animations are all temporary and *awful*. The actual visual part still needs a lot of work, but outside of some glaring bugs the tree that saves search information and suggests past searches works quite efficiently.
